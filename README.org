#+TITLE: ClassReader: A Set of Utilities for Reading Java Class Files
#+STARTUP: showall
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil ^:{}

This is a small collection of utilities for reading Java class files. The impetus for writing them was to improve the
performance of collecting metadata over a large set of Java files. Class loading is done with the [[https://crates.io/crates/cafebabe][cafebabe]] crate, which means
that newer versions of class files may not load correctly if =cafebabe= doesn't support them.

* Utilities
